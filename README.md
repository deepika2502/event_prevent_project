# event_prevent_project

While causality detection is widely investigated in literature, other interesting event relationships are not
studied enough. This is the case of event preventing another one to happen, or the conditions which enable an
event to happen.
The aim of this project is to automatically find prevent and enable event relationships in textual sources, by
using a combination of keyword selection and machine learning techniques.
